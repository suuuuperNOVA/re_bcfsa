## The Subdivision of Land and Title Registration in BC

> ### Who owns the land

- Provincial Crown
- Federal Crown
- Privately owned lands
- Treaty settlement lands
- Aboriginal title
    - cannot be sold except to Crown
    - established by court or contractual agreement between Crown and Aboriginal group (使用早于殖民)
    - developments require permission of Aboriginal title holders.

**Crown ownership**
: Provincial and federal lands.
- Not subdivided under *Land Title Act*
- Federal lands
    - Indian reserves<br>for the use and benefit of First Nations
    - national parks
    - national defense areas
    - federal habours.

**Treaty settlement lands**
: Each First Nation has extensive governance authority over the treaty lands.

> ### How land is subdivided

- Under *Land Title Act* and all local bylaws
- Require regulatory approval
- Dedicate some land as road, park, services at its own expense
- Subdivision plan at Land Title Office.

> ### Subdivisions

**Traditional**
: Two dimensional subdivision.

**Strata title**
: Strata owner owns the strata lot plus their proportionate share of the common property.

**Bare land strata development**
: Stratification of land rather than a building.

**Air space parcel**

Strata principles
- Strata is a strata
- Strata scheme is self-enforcing
- Reserve land subject to leasehold landlord provisions.

> ### How strata developments are created

1. Approval from local government
1. Near completion
1. Deposit strata plan at Land Title Office to show individual lots and common property
1. Land Title Office then issues a certificate of indefeasible title for each newly created strata lot.

**Leasehold strata development**
- Leased for a minimum of 50 years
- Register against the land as a charge
- Develop and file leasehold strata plan.

> ### How the common law dealing with the transfer of estates and interests in land has been changed by the Torrens system of title registration

**Deed**
: Any document under seal. A document used to transfer an interest in land from one party to another.

**Void deed**
- Forged deed
- In exchange for illegal act
- Not my deed.

Void deed can recover by the rightful owner in common law.

> ### Purpose of the Torrens system and how it is achieved

- Provide certainty in the holding of estates and interests in real property
- Remove the need for reviewing old title documents
- Guarantees
    - accurate reflection of true state of title
    - only relevant information source

Registration of a ==fee simple interest is absolute proof== of ownership, so long as that interest was acquired in **good faith** and **for valuable consideration**.

> ### Main components of our Torrens system

**Principle of indefeasibility**

Exceptions:
- Reservations contained in the original or other Crown grant
- Federal or Provincial or Municipal taxes, rates, charges or assessments, etc.
- Leases $\leq$ 3 years
- Highways or public rights of way, watercourses, public easements, etc.
- Expropriation or to an escheat
- Registered charges are not indefeasible
- The right of a person to show that the land is, by wrong description of boundaries, included in the certificate of title
- Fraud, including forgery, by the registered owner
- A restrictive condition imposed on the land by the Forest Act that is endorsed on title.

**Registration principle**

**Abolition of the doctrine of notice**

Knowledge of a pre-existing unregistered interest does not constitute fraud unless that knowledge is combined with dishonest conduct.

**Assurance fund**

Conditions for compensation
- No fault of their own
- If common law applies, claimant would have recovered
- Cannot recover by court action.
