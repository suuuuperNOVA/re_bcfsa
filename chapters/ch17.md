> ### Constraints imposed on value of mortgage by lending value of property and income of loan applicant

**Lending value**
: Long-term, conservative estimate of value of property pledged as security for a loan.<br><br>
Maximum Loan = Loan-to-value Ratio $\times$ Lending Value

- Loan-to-value ratio = 80% for federally chartered financial institutions
- $\geq$ 80% for insured mortgage (aka high ratio).

***Gross debt service ratio***
: $GDSR =\frac{P + I + T + \text{Registered Junior Mortgage Payment}}{GI} \leq$ 30%

***Total debt service ratio***
: $TDSR = \frac{P + I + T + \text{Other Payments}}{GI} \leq$ 40%

**Stress test**
- Greater of 5.25% or borrower's rate + 2%
- Applied to federally regulated lenders
- Loan available by using higher interest rate.

- Debt coverage ratio<br> DCR = $\frac{\text{Annual NOI}}{\text{Annual Mortgage Payments}}$
